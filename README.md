# News Topic Classification with NLP
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to automatically classify news articles into their respective topics. 


##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust text classification model that can predict the **topic/category** of a news article based on its content.  
The project follows a structured pipeline, from data preparation to model optimization, ensuring high accuracy and generalization.


##  Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (3.x)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **NLTK** / **spaCy**

  ##  Objective
To build a predictive model that accurately classifies news articles (or any text data) into predefined categories.


##  Methodology
1. **Data Loading** — Import and inspect raw text data.
2. **Data Cleaning** — Remove punctuation, lowercase text, and eliminate stopwords.
3. **Feature Extraction** — Use TF-IDF or Word Embeddings to convert text into vectors.
4. **Model Training** — Train multiple models (e.g., Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
5. **Model Evaluation** — Evaluate using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
6. **Optimization** — Fine-tune hyperparameters for best performance.


##  Key Learnings
- How to preprocess raw text data for machine learning
- TF-IDF feature extraction and dimensionality reduction
- Model comparison and fine-tuning in NLP workflows
- Importance of balanced datasets and cross-validation


##  Future Improvements
- Experiment with **deep learning models** (LSTM, BERT)
- Build a **web app** interface for live topic prediction
- Improve interpretability using **SHAP or LIME**
